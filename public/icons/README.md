## What's this directory ?

Icons used by categories.yaml and moreCategories.yaml to illustrate the searchable categories, and (new !) the map icons.

## Credits

More and more icons are custom designed using the wonderful [Inkscape project](https://inkscape.org/). Most other icons are sourced from the great [Maki project](https://github.com/mapbox/maki/) by MapBox, and other complementary sources like [Temaki](https://github.com/rapideditor/temaki) and [OSMand](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/icons/svg/).
