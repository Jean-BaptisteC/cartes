## Introduction

The beauty of Google Maps, the reason we almost all use it, is that it answers most of our usages of maps.

Is this restaurant open ? Google maps. Does the inside look cool enough ? Google Maps. Find the number to book a table ? How to go there ? Is it on my buses ? How long would I wait for the bus later ? Is the bus not too much crowded ?

Google Maps is not your classic mobile app, but more like an OS, an operating system. A geographical operating system encompassing most of our needs when we need to go somewhere at some point.

Like any OS, it's a complex infrastructure serving a simple user interface. Then Apple came ten years ago, failed, failed again, and finally succeeded in providing an even simpler version of this map operating system they crually needed to fill this important corner os iOS that Google took out of their control. Some other countries have local alternatives (France has Mappy.com, Czechia has... Mapy.com) but none is open source.

All the open-source alternatives are partial alternatives : they all rely on the incredible shared global map _database_ called OpenStreetMap, and try to solve one use case with a new interface. The most famous one, Organic Maps, is limited to mobile (and hence only run on Apple and Google OSes), forces one to plan map downloads, has no bus routes, has very few place images, etc.

One year ago, we decided to see how far we could go in building an open source alternative to these all-encompassing map applications, on the Web.

What do we have today ?
