## Place search

Google's search strenght were a key success of Google Maps. You don't need to go through a directory of place types to look for "greek restaurants" in Paris, nor select the search area.

We tried to reproduce this in Cartes with the technologies available : Photon by Komoot is our search engine. On top of it, we've built a directory of place types that can be queries directly with search terms.

Our directory brings Overpass's capabilites to the general public with human edited mappings. Dozens of user contributions were already treated to make the directory better.

In february 2025, our directory's icons were used to replace the old, ugly map icons for modern, background colored round place icons.

We know OSM's places often lack informations that Google has : opening times is the best exemple. We hope exposing OSM's data to the general public and [letting users and show owners quickly edit them](/roadmap#contribution) could give OSM a lead to catch Google.

Remember that Apple also lacks far behind Google for its incomplete place directory. That hasn't stopped Apple from winning back millions of users who had the choice of using Google instead.

This fragmentation between Google, Apple, Microsoft and a handful of local actors is OSM's strength now : data contributed to OSM is free.
