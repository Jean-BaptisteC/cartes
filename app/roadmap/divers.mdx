## Telemetry

Google's wide user base lets them build features out of user localisation data. We do have plans for this, including publishing free public interest data, but obviously we first need to get more than 100 000 users per month in France.

## Miscellaneous

We've initiated a discussion about our users' "dream" features. Most of them are not hard to implement as a first version.
