## Street imagery

We're using the French open source and OSM backed initiative [Panoramax](https://panoramax.fr).

Nothing more to say here : Panoramax is an awesome, funded project, that we aim to make more visible through our general public map application. Contrary to Google, Apple, Mappy, and the others' initiatives, Panoramax is a collaborative database, much like OpenStreetMap.

Panoramax's infrastructure is in place, lots of places are missing 360 images but whole French cities already contributed great datasets. We need a collective effort to have good French coverage.
