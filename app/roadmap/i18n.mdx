## Internationalisation

One uses Google Maps in one language and mostly in one country. One does not realize how difficult it is to expand a map application to any country on earth. Google Maps is often seen as a monolithic map database maintained by a unique company, but it's not : it started as an series of aquisitions of startups, and its data is now bought to dozens of local entreprises that map the world for Google.

We do have advantages that Google does not : OpenStreetMap could have been called OpenWorldMap. Lots of places are already translated for tourists. Also, note that the surface of the interface that contains text that should be translated is reduced, since the map remains the main interest.

However, internationalising an app has consequences out of the product itself : the community of developers working on the project consists of real people, some more fluent than others in English, French, German, Dutch, etc.

Cartes is built in France, in French. We wanted to check the interest before thinking global. We wanted to speak the language of the people we're passing by everyday, let them open issues in their native language, the one in which they're doing the least effort and being the most expressive. Hundreds of messages have been written on the French OSM forum, a thriving community of enthusiast cartographers that were cruelly missing a modern Web map interface.

We'll more and more think European, now that the US let us down by electing a fascist president. We'll start to internationalize the application.

We'll keep French as a main language : remember that no country in the European union natively speak english anymore. English remains the best language for international discussions though.

We expect contributors to be OK to often stumble upon French comments, as we now expect French people to handle english comments too : remember to use the awesome translation tools that are popping every month. We hope Github will one day aknowledge the existence of the rest of the world and add a "translate" button under issue comments...
