## Itineraries

Google Maps, along with Waze, is a standard for car navigation. In France, using GMaps for bike navigation is often mocked, as its cycle map database is well known to be stale, directing you to closed countryside parks and dangerous busy city boulevards.

But Google Maps has invested big on transit, building its own data format, GTFS, gone standard.

Cartes has a deep focus on transit. We ambition to be the first planet friendly generic map application. We're catching up on Google on transit in France, aiming at a coverage of 90 %, and an interface that adds proper multimodal directions. The bike mode is already good enough, using the incredible BRouter software.

See this issue to [understand the transit challenge](https://github.com/cartesapp/cartes/issues/832).

Our car mode is lacking behind. We'd like to [advise people to use Organic Maps for navigation](https://github.com/cartesapp/cartes/issues/831).
