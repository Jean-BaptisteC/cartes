## Contribution

### Contributing to OpenStreetMap places

The main OSM contribution interfaces are quite complicated. For instance, the official "id" editor has no opening times widget : you need to "code" the opening time, not click on buttons to define them.

On Cartes, we're planning to let the user change only a handful of OSM data, like OSMapp.org, OrganicMaps and OSMAnd did.

Contributing to OpenStreetMap shapes (roads, natural features) is of course out of scope.

### Place reviews

A good map application needs user comments. We're not fond of ratings, but we really like reviews.

Ratings are often corrupted (see [this blog post in French](https://cartes.app/blog/un-beau-voyage)) : show owner cheating is generalized ; tourist advice often crushes local advices which globabizes restaurants ; reviews often serve as a means of pressure by tourists.

But comments include interesting informations, e.g. keywords like "crÃªpes" for a restaurant that could be used for search.

We will not build our infrastructure for this : existing networks of small user messages already exist in the Fediverse used by Mastodon and the AT protocol used by Bluesky.

See the relevant issue for details on why this is possible and interesting.
