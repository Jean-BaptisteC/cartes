## Contribution

The main OSM contribution interfaces are quite complicated. For instance, the official "id" editor has no opening times widget : you need to "code" the opening time, not click on buttons to define them. On Cartes, we're planning to let the user change only a handful of OSM data, like OSMapp.org, OrganicMaps and OSMAnd did.
