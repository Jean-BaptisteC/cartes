  One year ago, we started building an open source alternative to Google and Apple Maps. What does it take to do that ? How far have we gone ? What's next ?

The beauty of Google Maps, the reason we almost all use it, is that it answers most of our usages of maps.

Is this restaurant open ? Google maps. Does the inside look cool enough ? Google Maps. Find the number to book a table ? How to go there ? Is it on my buses ? How long would I wait for the bus later ? Is the bus not too much crowded ?

Google Maps is not your classic mobile app, but more like an OS, an operating system. A geographical operating system encompassing most of our needs when we need to go somewhere at some point.

Like any OS, it's a complex infrastructure serving a simple user interface. Then Apple came ten years ago, failed, failed again, and finally succeeded in providing an even simpler version of this map operating system they crually needed to fill this important corner os iOS that Google took out of their control. Some other countries have local alternatives (France has Mappy.com, Czechia has... Mapy.com) but none is open source.

All the open-source alternatives are partial alternatives : they all rely on the incredible shared global map _database_ called OpenStreetMap, and try to solve one use case with a new interface. The most famous one, Organic Maps, is limited to mobile (and hence only run on Apple and Google OSes), forces one to plan map downloads, has no bus routes, has very few place images, etc.

One year ago, we decided to see how far we could go in building an open source alternative to these all-encompassing map applications, on the Web.

> ...and on the Web only, mobile development being way too expensive.

What do we have today ?

## Basemaps

We're using MapLibre to instantiate a canvas where the map will be drawn using your device's GPU, making it faster than traditional Web maps.

> MapLibre is a fork of MapBox, which itself was an open source alternative to Google Maps's hosting service that gained traction when Google raised its prices.

MapLibre is just a client renderer that talks to a server to know what data to draw. We started using the Swiss and French-speaking MapTiler and its great panoply of basemaps.

Once you have map data to show, you need to decide how you'll show them : should buildings be gray or brown ? Should roads be yellow or gray ? This is defined in MapLibre JSON stylesheets, and also provided by MapTiler. We first customized their base style for with our own design choices.

But we soon hit higher than expected spending : to serve our first few thousand users, we had a 150 ‚Ç¨/month MapTiler invoice.

So we built our own : on top of limiting costs to a fixed 50 ‚Ç¨/month of a French Scaleway server using Protomaps's ingenious technology, it let us customise not only the style but the _data_ we wanted to show to our users, departing from MapTiler's tile standard called OpenMapTiles.

OpenStreetMap is rich, sometimes incredibly rich. In most cases, especially in cities, you don't want to show _all_ of OSM's data to your users to avoid drawning key information in details. If the style serves as the ultimate filter, the whole point of tiles design is to carefully select some features (places, trees, shops, trash bins...) for some level of zooms only, in order to save bandwidth space.

Open map tile standards (OpenMapTiles, Shortbread, Protomaps) are great for projects that want to embed maps, but fail short for projects that are rethink maps themselves.

Conclusion : we now have a main custom map style (+ tiles), but also provide interesting third-party specialized styles.

## Interface

We've built a basic interface that adapts to mobile or desktop. Working on the modal sheet (the bottom content block that slides up and down with your finger) was hard (we cloned and corrected an existing lib), as nobody has yet built a Web mobile style sheet : all the $ went to Android and Apple development.

Place pages are the basics of a working digital map. Openstreetmap.org's place icons are not clickable because the map is not vector but raster. We had to encode the OSM place id + place type (node/way/relation) inside or own tiles : most tiles do not let us make the link to the OSM API to retrieve the full set of data of a place, and hence display a place page.

The place page needs lots of other sources of data to be interesting enough for the user. We need Wikipedia, its pictures, Wikimedia common's pictures, Wikidata facts, train station live train times, cinema snippets, etc. The list goes on, it's just a matter of implementing the right stuff. We're looking for the most open source of data for each domain.

### Internationalisation

Cartes is built in France, in French. We wanted to check the interest before thinking global. We wanted to speak the language of the people we're passing by everyday, let them open issues in their native language, the one in which they're doing the least effort and being the most expressive. Hundreds of messages have been written on the French OSM forum, a thriving community of enthusiast cartographers that were cruelly missing a modern Web map interface.

We'll more and more think European, now that the US let us down by electing a fascist president. We'll start to internationalize the application.

We'll keep French as a main language : remember that no country in the European union natively speak english anymore. English remains the best language for international discussions though. Remember to use the awesome translation tools that are popping every month. We hope Github will one day aknowledge the existence of the rest of the world and add a "translate" button under issue comments...

## Navigation

## Contributing to OpenStreetMap

The main OSM contribution interfaces are quite complicated. For instance, the official "id" editor has no opening times widget : you need to "code" the opening time, not click on buttons to define them. On Cartes, we're planning to let the user change only a handful of OSM data, like OSMapp.org, OrganicMaps and OSMAnd did.
