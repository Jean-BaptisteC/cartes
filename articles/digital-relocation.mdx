  Our digital dependence on the United States is extreme. It is urgent to anchor digital relocation inside our reindustrialization plans.

A year ago, we launched the "Cartes" project: creating an open and eco-friendly digital map , built in France. Since then, Trump has been re-elected rather than imprisoned. Musk greatly helped him by making his personality, our naivety, his fortune, and his acquisition of Twitter decisive electoral weapons targeting the failing American democracy.

Then he gave a Nazi salute during the inauguration ceremony of the most powerful president in the world, before starting a proactive power grab that looks very much like a coup d'Ã©tat.

The CEO of Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) has embraced Trump's ultra-conservative politics. The other GAFAM companies have docilely fallen in line as first-level constituents of this new plutocratic bloc. Even the Swedish Spotify, a second-level digital giant, has pledged allegiance to the president of this country on the path to fascism.

In France, the cables of this foreign interference tool called X that Musk uses to elect far-right parties in Europe have still not been cut. It is not hard to understand why: the overwhelming majority of our politicians are still hyper-active on it, as shows our joint [X activity analysis project](https://politix.top), both on the right and more surprinsigly, on the left.

For these members of the so-called French "republican front" 200,000 followers (a significant portion of which are bots) are definitely worth more than a boycott of the most powerful far-right media where their voice weighs less than a grimace on Pascal Praud's show [the most infamous French far-right TV's plateau].
